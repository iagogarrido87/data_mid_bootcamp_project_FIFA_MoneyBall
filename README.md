# FIFA21
In this project, I have chosen the FIFA21 database as the dataset for analysis.
FIFA21 is a popular video game that simulates professional soccer,
and its database contains various attributes and statistics of soccer players from around the world.

## 1. Objective
The goal is to clean and preprocess the data to predict the market value,
in addition to analyzing different insights.

## 2. Data
The DataFrame has 17,125 rows and 107 columns. It contains a combination of numerical data (float64 and int64) and object data (text strings)

## 3. Data cleaning

- Checking for missing values
- Handling missing numerical values: For the columns 'Volleys', 'Curve', 'Agility', 'Balance', 'Jumping', 'Vision', 'Sliding Tackle', 'Composure', 'Interceptions', and 'Positioning', the missing values are filled using the mean or median of the respective columns. The code calculates the mean for 'Volleys', 'Curve', 'Sliding Tackle', 'Composure', and 'Interceptions' using the mean() function, and the median for 'Agility', 'Balance', 'Jumping', 'Vision', and 'Positioning' using the median() function. The fillna() function is used to fill the missing values in these columns with the calculated mean or median
- Handling missing categorical values: The missing values in the 'Club' column are filled with the string 'WITHOUT A CLUB', indicating that the player doesn't belong to any club. The missing values in the 'Position' column are filled with the values from the 'BP' (Best Position) column, assuming the best position is the same as the primary position.
- Handling missing values in other columns: The missing values in the 'A/W' (Attack Work Rate), 'D/W' (Defense Work Rate), and 'Joined' columns are filled with the values 'MEDIUM', 'MEDIUM', and 'Dec 31, 2020' respectively. These values are chosen as reasonable defaults.
- Dropping unnecessary columns: The code drops the columns 'Player Photo', 'Club Logo', 'Flag Photo', and 'Loan Date End' using the drop() function with axis=1 to remove those columns from the DataFrame.
- Data type conversion: The code performs data type conversions for certain columns. It removes the Euro symbol 'â‚¬' from the 'Value', 'Wage', and 'Release Clause' columns using the str.replace() function. It replaces 'M' with 'e6' and 'K' with 'e3' to represent millions and thousands respectively. Then it converts the columns to float data type using the astype() function.
